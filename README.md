### Morpho-Aave-V3 related functions, in Typescript.

One can use one of the following functions to get relevant data:

- getTotalSupply
- getTotalBorrow

- getTotalMarketSupply
- getTotalMarketBorrow

- getCurrentSupplyBalanceInOf
- getCurrentCollateralBalanceInOf
- getCurrentBorrowBalanceInOf

- getCurrentUserSupplyRatePerYear
- getCurrentUserBorrowRatePerYear

- getP2PSupplyRate

### Morpho-Aave-V3 related functions in Solidity.

One can use the following snippets to get relevant data:

- totalSupply
- totalBorrow

- supplyAPR
- borrowAPR
- avgBorrowAPR

- healthFactor

- marketSupply
- marketBorrow

- supplyBalance
- borrowBalance

- poolAPR
- assetPrice

The Utils library gathers some pieces of code used in the snippets. You can also visit the [MorphoGetters.sol](https://github.com/morpho-dao/morpho-aave-v3/src/MorphoGetters.sol) file to have a look at all the data available from the Morpho Contract.

### Getting Started

- Install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).
- Install yarn
- Run foundryup
- Run forge install
- Create a `.env` file according to the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) file.

### Testing with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) ðŸ”¨

Tests are run against a fork of real networks, which allows us to interact directly with liquidity pools of Aave V3. Note that you need to have an RPC provider that have access to Ethereum.

You can run the test by running the command: `forge test`

### VSCode setup

Configure your VSCode to automatically format a file on save, using `forge fmt`:

- Install [emeraldwalk.runonsave](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave)
- Update your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "[solidity]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": false
  },
  "emeraldwalk.runonsave": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "match": ".sol",
        "isAsync": true,
        "cmd": "forge fmt ${file}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
